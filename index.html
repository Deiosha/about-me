  <main>
    <p>Hello, my name is Sharmarke Nur. I was born and raised in the city of Seattle area. I am the second of five in my family. I have attended the University of Washington after graduating at Renton High school. I have worked and volunteered at a mini market in Rainier and now am a substitute with the Imagine Institute, working with helping home child care. My goals are being a software developer, hence the reason I am attending Code Fellows and look to graduate at Code Fellows. </p>
